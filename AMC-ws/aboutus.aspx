              <p>American Music Company, Inc’s music catalog currently consists
                of thousands of tracks of music. Each of our main themes is
                approximately 2-5 minutes in length, and includes pre-edited
                :60’s, :30’s, :15’s and stings / tags that we created for each
                main themes. Of course, your creative team is allowed to edit
                our main themes anyway that they want.

                wonderful diversity of musical styles and genres. Each year, we
                produce an additional 200 tracks of new music, and these too,
                will all be included in any music licensing package and provided
                to each facility that signs up with us.
