                <p>A Needle Drop is one specific use of one particular selection
                  of music within one individual production. It makes no
                  difference if the selection of music used is five seconds or
                  five minutes in length. All that matters is how many times
                  this specific selection of music is used within that
                  production. For example: If a selection of music is used ten
                  times, in part or in whole, it is still considered ten Needle
                  Drops. The same concept applies even if there are ten
                  different selections of music used one time each. The
                  production is still considered as having ten Needle Drops.</p>

                <h4 class="project">What is a Local Clearance?</h4>
                <p>We interpret this to mean that any production, whether it be
                  a program, promo or commercial and will have exposure within a
                  single state will be considered a local use. The exception to
                  this would be the major markets. For example: NYC and the
                  Tri-State area, Boston, Chicago, Miami, Boca, Dallas, Ft.
                  Worth and Los Angeles will not be considered local and will be
                  treated as regional in nature due to their higher population
                  densities. However, the exception to this rule would be the
                  local access scenario.</p>

                <h4 class="project">What is a Regional Clearance?</h4>
                <p>We are generously interpreting this in order to provide a
                  broader meaning to the territory covered by this clearance
                  category. From our point of view we have divided up the USA
                  into six geographic regions. The Northeast states, Southeast
                  states, North Midwest states, South Midwest states, Northwest
                  states and the Southwest states. Basically, a regional
                  clearance is granted to any program, promo or commercial that
                  will have exposure in up to eight states.</p>

              <div class="col-sm-offset-1">
                <h4 class="project">What is a National Clearance?</h4>
                <p>This is probably the easiest interpretation of all. Any
                  production, program, promo or commercial that will be seen or
                  heard and have exposure throughout the entire USA by means of
                  any major broadcast, cable or satellite network. This
                  clearance category will also apply to spots targeted for
                  multiple local and or multiple regional territories throughout
                  the country.</p>

                <h4>What is a Sound Recording?</h4>
                <p>Sound recordings are defined in the law as works that result
                  from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken or other
                  sounds. Copyright in a sound recording protects the particular
                  series of sounds "fixed" (embodied in a recording) against
                  unauthorized reproduction and revision and unauthorized
                  distribution of those sounds, and certain unauthorized
                  performances by means of a digital audio transmission.</p>

                <h4>What is Copyright?</h4>
                <p>Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the
                  United States to the authors of "original works of
                  authorship," including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic
                  and certain other intellectual works. This protection is
                  available to both published and unpublished works. Section 106
                  of the 1976 Copyright Act generally gives the owner of
                  copyright the exclusive right to authorize others to
                  reproduce, to perform the work publicly and to prepare
                  derivative works incorporating their work.</p>

                <h4>What is Public Domain?</h4>
                <p>Works published in the United States with a copyright date of
                  1922 or earlier are in the the public domain. Do not be fooled
                  by the term "Public Domain"... it can be tricky. Just because
                  a musical composition or arrangement may be in the proverbial
                  public domain, does not mean that you automatically can use it
                  willy nilly in your production without paying for it. You must
                  be absolutely certain that the specific recording you are
                  using is also in the public domain. Chances are, that the
                  recording you have selected is not in the public domain.
                  Permission and proper clearance from the owners of this
                  recording must be obtained. Of course you are legally free to
                  spend your own money and have any public domain musical
                  composition arranged, performed and recorded. Then you would
                  be the proud owner of this particular master recording and
                  everyone else would need your permission to use it. Every
                  musical composition owned and provided by American Music
                  Company is without exception copyrighted and is not in the
                  public domain.</p>

                <h4>What About Works Originally Created and Published or
                  Registered before January 1, 1978?</h4>
                <p>Under the law in effect before 1978, the copyright endured
                  for a first term of 28 years from the date it was secured.
                  During the last 28th year of the first term, the copyright was
                  eligible for renewal. The Copyright Act of 1976 extended the
                  renewal term from 28 to 47 years for copyrights that were in
                  place prior to January 1, 1978, making these works eligible
                  for a total term of protection of 75 years. Public Law
                  105-298, enacted on October 27, 1978, further extended the
                  renewal term of copyrights still subsisting on that date by an
                  additional 20 years, providing for a renewal term of 67 years
                  and a total term of protection of 95 years.</p>

                <h4>Did You Know That Copyright Protection is Automatic?</h4>
                <p>Under the 1976 Copyright Act, which became effective January
                  1, 1978, a work is automatically protected by copyright when
                  it is created. A work is created when it is "fixed" in a copy
                  for the first time. Neither registration in the Copyright
                  Office nor publication is required for copyright protection
                  under the present law.</p>

                <h4>How Long Does Copyright Protection Endure?</h4>
                <p>A work that is created for the first time on or after January
                  1, 1978 is automatically protected from the moment of its
                  creation and is ordinarily given a term enduring for the
                  author's life plus an additional 70 years after the author's
                  death. For works made for hire, the duration of copyright will
                  be 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation,
                  whichever is shorter.</p>
