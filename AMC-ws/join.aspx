                    <h4>Concept 1:</h4>
                    <i>Annual Music Subscription</i> (Pay one price for the year
                    and use as much music as you want, in all of your
                    productions.) All of the music downloading is unlimited and
                    free, including free music research and assistance.
                    Licensing concepts are posted on our web site. Prices are
                    customized based on clearances needed and potential music
                    usage.

                    <i>A La Carte</i> (Needle Drop: per production / per use of
                    music) An easy way to get started without having to make any
                    yearly blanket commitments. There is a $45.00 annual
                    membership fee to sign up and create an online account. All
                    of the music downloading is unlimited and free, including
                    free music research and assistance. You pay only for the
                    music that you actually use.

                  Let us know if you are interested in a yearly blanket license,
                  and we will be happy to give you a special price quote based
                  on your licensing needs. <br>
                  Both plans offer free and unlimited personal music search and
                  assistance. The music search feature that is on our website,
                  is fast, easy and intuitive, but sometimes it's nice to run
                  your idea by another human and get some personal help and
                  attention. That's what we are here for! </p>
